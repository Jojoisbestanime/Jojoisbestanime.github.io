<center><h1> My Favorite Characters <h1></center>
<center><p>Iggy The Fool</p></center><br>
<center><img src="Images/Iggy.gif" alt="Iggy"></center>
<center><p> Iggy is one of my favorite characters because one he is a dog. He is a bit of an asshole to
	a majority of the Stardust Crusaders but, even though his is a dick he has his good heroic moments by saving a child 
	from a ice shooting hawk, and saving Polnareff. I loved his development as a character over the adventure in Egypt<p></center>






<center><p>Joseph Joestar</p></center><br>
<center><img src="Images/Running.gif" alt="Running"></center>
<center><p> Joseph Joestar one of my favorite Joestars because he isn't the proper hero. He relies on tricks and lying in order to 
	win. yet he does fight for a just cause he still is just a clown most of the time. Seeing him come back to help other Joestars
	throughout the series and grow as a character as well makes him one of my favorite Jojos<p></center>




<center><p>Jotaro Kujo</p></center><br>
<center><img src="Images/Kujo.gif" alt="Kujo"></center>
<center><p> I'm a sucker for a badass edgy boy so of course Jotaro will be on my list. He is just such a serious characer that has really cool 
	outfits throughout the series. His fights through the series are insane and very enjoyable. Like lets be honest the man can use his stand to stop time,
	it's insanly strong and broken ability.Mostly I enjoy a good badass character I just have a soft spot for them. <p></center>

<center><p>Rohan Kishibe</p></center><br>
<center><img src="Images/Heavensdoor.gif" alt="Gate"></center>
<center><p> Rohan has one of the coolest abilites. His abilites name is Heaven Door and it able to read a person's life and change things about them. For
example he uses his ablility on any person that seems suspicious and writes that they can't hurt them before doing anything. He hate the main Jojo thoughout 
Part 4 and I find his character super interesting and enjoyable to see his interactions with other characters.   <p></center>


<center><p>Robert E.O. Speedwagon</p></center><br>
<center><img src="Images/Speedwagon.gif" alt="Speedwagon"></center>
<center><p> Speedwagon is the Greatest Jojo Character of all time. He advances the whole universe. He is super rich, gives anyone from the Joestar Bloodline anything
that could every want. He Speedwagon Foundation helps all Jojos even after his passing. Fan believe there is a motto for anyone that works in the Speedwagon
Foundation," We shall never deny a Jojo, even the most ridiculous request."<p></center>


<center><p>Giorno Giovanna</p></center><br>
<center><img src="Images/GioGio.gif" alt="GioGio"></center>
<center><p> Giorno Giovanna has two daddies, one mom, and a dream. This Jojo is just so fun to watch in action due to his Stand, Gold Experience, which has
	so much diversity in battle. He is a down to earth character but unlike other Jojo's he isn't apposed to killing. Giorno wants to change the Gang world
	by joining a gang and changing it within. Also in the ending of Part 5 "GER" is an insane stand that I just love<p></center>
