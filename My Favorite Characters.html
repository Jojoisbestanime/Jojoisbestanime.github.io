<center><h1> My Favorite Characters <h1></center>
<center><p>Iggy The Fool</p></center><br>
<center><img src="Images/Iggy.gif" alt="Iggy"></center>
<center><p> Iggy is one of my favorite characters because one he is a dog. He is a bit of an asshole to
	a majority of the Stardust Crusaders but, even though his is a dick he has his good heroic moments by saving a child 
	from a ice shooting hawk, and saving Polnareff. I loved his development as a character over the adventure in Egypt<p></center>






<center><p>Joseph Joestar</p></center><br>
<center><img src="Images/Running.gif" alt="Running"></center>
<center><p> Joseph Joestar one of my favorite Joestars because he isn't the proper hero. He relies on tricks and lying in order to 
	win. yet he does fight for a just cause he still is just a clown most of the time. Seeing him come back to help other Joestars
	throughout the series and grow as a character as well makes him one of my favorite Jojos<p></center>




<center><p>Jotaro Kujo</p></center><br>
<center><img src="Images/Kujo.gif" alt="Kujo"></center>
<center><p> I'm a sucker for a badass edgy boy so of course Jotaro will be on my list. He is just such a serious characer that has really cool 
	outfits throughout the series. His fights through the series are insane and very enjoyable. Mostly I enjoy a good badass character I just have a 
	soft spot for them. <p></center>
