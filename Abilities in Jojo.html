<center><img src="Images/Stand.gif" alt="Stand"></center>
<center><p>Stands are defined as personifications of "life energy" whose abilities are given visual form. According to Joseph Joestar, the name "Stand" comes from the fact they usually manifest standing next to the User: ready to act. A Stand can also represent the manifestation of an individual's innate "fighting spirit" and embodies, to an extent, the individual's psyche. However, Stands may also derive through the exploration of possibilities and expression of the mind, in which case, only a large amount of mental strength is required. Beyond that definition, Stands present themselves in a large variety of forms and with different behaviors, if they are sentient at all. They follow a loose set of rules, with no definite standard by which one can fully classify them. As an embodiment of someone's psyche, Stands are therefore as varied as human minds can be.

<center><img src="Images/Spin.gif" alt="Spin"></center>
<center><p>The Spin is a state of rotation defined by its closeness to perfection, that perfection being the Golden Rectangle, more specifically the Golden Spiral that is derived from the Rectangle, a mathematically endless spiral, and a feature said to be omnipresent in the surrounding nature and a fortiori in works of arts.

Unlike the average rotation, the Spin is persistent and produces more rotational energy than it takes to create. That rotational energy is transferred to nearby objects in the form of vibrations and can be wielded for a wide array of purposes.

The Spin is a specialty of the Kingdom of Naples. It is intensively used there either for medicine or for battle. All characters who know the Spin are either Neapolitan or have been taught by a Neapolitan.
